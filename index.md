# Done-for-you website & digital management

I help business owners who want **one person** to handle their website, updates, SEO, ads, and social media — so they can focus on running the business.

No freelancers to manage.  
No chasing multiple vendors.  
No technical headaches.

---

## Who this is for

This is for business owners who:
- Want their website and online presence **handled end-to-end**
- Already have content or can provide it
- Prefer monthly support over one-time projects
- Want a single point of responsibility

If you want to DIY, experiment, or micromanage tools — this is not a fit.

## How it works

1. We align on goals and scope

You always know who is responsible. It’s me.
